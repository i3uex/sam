# A _Note_ About These Notebooks

There are some interesting considerations to take into account about certain details of this companion project that better fit in a Jupyter Notebook than as code comments.

Make sure to install [Jupyter][jupyter] if you want to be able to run these notebooks.

The following notebooks are available:

- **get_slice.ipynb**: describes the process of extracting a slice from a given NIfTI.
- **windowing.ipynb**: shows how to enhance contrast for a particular organ in a given slice of a CT image.
- **coordinates_conventions.ipynb**: explains the reasons behind the decision to follow the row, column coordinates convention in this project.
- **mask_center.ipynb**: the basis for moving the centroids inside the corresponding mask when it lands outside are described in this notebook.
